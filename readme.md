# FashoTyped.ts

A collection of TypeScript resources I came across while learning or improving new-found knowledge

I wanted to create this for myself and for those who want to find quick access to resources for TypeScript. I believe in sharing knowledge, but also sharing what you find is even better.

I'll also share notes from Meetups i'll be attending or just watch old ones I missed ðŸ˜….
